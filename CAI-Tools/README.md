###### Big Avatars
You can change the size of avatars in your chats. They can also be animated now.
###### Background Manager (premium)
Activate or disable Main and Roleplay background however you wish. Roleplay backgrounds work with the message input, if you start with "##" and start typing for a keyword, it will search in your custom and starter roleplay background list keywords. Upon clicking on a keyword, it will change the background. You could create a huge library of your own. Image links are strongly recommended if you don't want delays or lags, try Imgur or other image upload sites. (Doesn't support legacy website.)
###### Font Manager (premium)
Change your text sizes, font families and text colors for a better experience.
###### Chat Summary
Click one button to summarize the chat using ChatGPT. It's more efficient than Memory Manager, but has limitations from ChatGPT.
###### Character Import
You can import character cards and .json files and it will create a private character with the those settings. Character.ai, V1 and V2 cards should work, not tested with others if there are any. https://chub.ai recommended for having many SFW options.
